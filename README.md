# python-Dijkstra
Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path from a point to all other points in a weighted graph. The program uses custom Min-Heap and Linked-List/ Adjacency-List classes to represent the graph, and outputs the shortest path from the source to the rest of the connected nodes.
